title: Britain’s Homelessness Crisis: Are Councils Fighting a Losing Battle?

Humayra exhales sharply, rubbing her temples before taking a sip of her now-cold coffee. It’s the middle of the afternoon, and she’s already drowning in a week’s worth of cases. Officially, she’s supposed to work from home four days a week, but the sheer volume of people needing housing keeps pulling her back to her desk in Hackney Council’s overstretched offices.

> “I had a woman crying on the phone this morning,” she tells me. “She’s been evicted, nowhere to go, kids in the back of the car. What do I say to her? I have to house them, no matter the cost.”

The cost, as it turns out, is astronomical. Research suggests that council spending on housing the homeless has skyrocketed by almost 400% between 2018 and 2024, with councils across Britain shelling out £1.6 billion on temporary accommodation in the past five years.

Humayra has worked as a housing officer for over five years, splitting her time between Lambeth and Hackney. When asked which borough is harder: “Hackney, hands down,” she says. “Private landlords don’t want to give up their properties to council tenants, not when the average house price is around £600,000.”

The lack of housing is forcing councils to rely on hostels, hotels, and B&Bs. “Do you know how much we’ve paid Travelodge in the last five years? £26.1 million. Homelessness is making some people a lot of money.”

While she used to work with families, she now handles single tenants—people who often fall through the cracks of the system. “These are some of the toughest cases I’ve ever had to deal with,” she says. “Young people kicked out of their homes, people coming out of prison… entitlement makes me want to pull my hair out sometimes.” She pauses. “I get why they feel that way, though. If you’re desperate, you expect the system to catch you. But the truth is, we’re drowning.”

There are also checks and balances in place. “One guy said he couldn’t work, but his bank statement showed he’d been travelling up and down the country… I had to send him away to the job centre,” she explains. “Harsh, maybe, but I have to make sure housing goes to those who need it most.”

On the government’s pledge to build 1.5 million homes, she scoffs: “The last government made the same empty promises. They had COVID to blame. What excuse will this one have?”

When asked about balancing help between local homeless people and asylum seekers, she shifts uncomfortably. “I don’t have all the answers. I just know this isn’t sustainable.”

She sighs, glancing at her overflowing inbox. “Tomorrow, there’ll be another eviction, another desperate phone call, another case I have to handle.” And on what Prime Minister Keir Starmer will do? “I don’t think even he knows.”
